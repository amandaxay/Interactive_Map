# Interactive_Map
InMap: Interactive Map Journal - A journal application where you can log the states
youâ€™ve traveled to and the cities, national parks, state parks, and other points of interests.
The map will be interactive by showing a map of the united states, each state will be clickable to let users 
log journal entries allowing them to input their journal entry and can select points of interest based on pre-uploaded pictures on the map.
The user will be able to create a journal entry about their experience at the desired location and optionally upload a few of their favorite pictures.
